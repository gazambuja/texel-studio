# Texel Studio

**The only pixel art tool that actually paints like a real artist.**

Every other AI pixel art generator is a diffusion model pretending to understand pixels. They output blurry approximations — inconsistent colors, broken edges, half-pixel artifacts, and results that look different every time you run the same prompt. They don't understand what a pixel *is*.

Texel Studio is different. An AI agent picks up a brush, places pixels on a canvas one at a time, steps back to look at what it drew, and decides what to fix. It uses shapes, noise fills, and detail tools — the same way a human pixel artist works. Every pixel is intentional. Every color is from your palette. The output is exact, consistent, and game-ready.

This is the open-source engine that powers [texel.studio](https://texel.studio).

## How it works

1. **Describe** what you want ("a mossy cobblestone block")
2. **Generate concept art** — AI creates a reference image for guidance
3. **Confirm** the reference (or revise with feedback)
4. **Watch the agent paint** — it uses drawing tools to build the sprite step by step
5. **Chat to edit** — tell the agent "make the top darker" and it continues painting
6. **Export** — native size PNG, upscaled 512px, or full autotile tileset (16 variants)

### Generation modes

| `mode` | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| `auto` (default) | **Image-first** when a reference image is present (fast, deterministic: resize → quantize to palette → background/despeckle cleanup), otherwise the step-by-step **agent**. |
| `image-first` | Always run the deterministic pipeline. With no reference, a concept image is generated first. |
| `agent` | Always the step-by-step painting agent. |

Set `refine: true` to run a short agent cleanup pass **seeded from** the
image-first result (fixes stray pixels / broken edges without redrawing).
When no palette is supplied, one is derived from the reference.

## Why not diffusion?

| | Diffusion generators | **Texel Studio** |
|---|---|---|
| Output | Blurry approximation scaled down | **Exact palette-indexed pixels** |
| Colors | Random, needs post-processing | **Your palette, every time** |
| Consistency | Different result every run | **Deterministic tool calls** |
| Edges | Anti-aliased, half-pixels | **Clean, game-ready edges** |
| Control | Prompt and pray | **Chat to refine, pixel by pixel** |
| Process | Black box | **Watch it paint, step by step** |
| Tileable | Almost never | **Built-in autotile generation** |

Diffusion models hallucinate pixels. This tool places them.

## Agent Tools

**Drawing**
- `draw_pixel`, `draw_pixels` — individual pixels
- `fill_rect`, `fill_row`, `fill_column` — rectangular fills
- `draw_line` — Bresenham lines
- `draw_circle`, `draw_ellipse` — round shapes (filled or outline)
- `draw_triangle` — filled triangles
- `draw_rotated_rect` — angled rectangles

**Texture**
- `noise_fill_rect`, `noise_fill_circle` — random color distribution for natural variation
- `voronoi_fill` — cell/stone patterns (cobblestone, rocks, organic surfaces)

**Inspection**
- `view_canvas` — see current pixel grid + color usage
- `get_pixel` — check a single pixel value

## Features

- **Sprite types** — Block (tileable) and Item Icon (transparent bg) with type-specific prompts
- **Multi-provider** — Gemini, OpenAI, and local Ollama models (100% free with Ollama)
- **Concept art reference** — AI generates a reference image before pixel painting
- **Live streaming** — watch the sprite build in real-time via SSE
- **Chat continuation** — send follow-up edits to the same agent session
- **Manual pixel editing** — click to paint, right-click to erase
- **Palette management** — create, edit, and reuse color palettes
- **Autotile generation** — generate all 16 edge variants for tilemap use
- **Export** — native PNG, upscaled preview, or full tileset folder
- **History** — browse and reload past generations
- **S3 storage** — optional S3-compatible object storage for shared file access across workers
- **Observability** — optional LangSmith and/or PostHog LLM analytics tracing

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EYamanS/texel-studio.git
cd texel-studio

# Quick start (handles everything)
./start.sh

# Or set up manually:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env       # edit with your API key(s)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
python server.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8500`

## Authentication

You need at least one AI provider configured:

**Ollama (free, runs locally)**
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model:
  ```bash
  ollama pull ggml-org/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF:Q8_0
  ```
- Add to `.env`:
  ```bash
  OLLAMA_MODELS=ggml-org/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF:Q8_0
  # OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434   # default, only set if different
  ```
- That's it — no API keys, no accounts, no cost. The model runs on your machine.
- You can list multiple models: `OLLAMA_MODELS=gemma-4:8b,llama3.1:8b,qwen3:8b`
- Recommended models for pixel art: `ggml-org/gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF:Q8_0`, `qwen3:8b`, `llama3.1:8b`

**Gemini** (for both concept art + agent painting)
- Get a free API key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- Add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key` to `.env`
- Or use a Google Cloud service account for Vertex AI

**OpenAI** (agent painting only, concept art still uses Gemini)
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key` to `.env`

**OpenAI-compatible servers** (Llama.cpp, VLLM, LM Studio, OpenRouter, etc.)
- Point at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint and register the model names you want in the UI:
  ```bash
  OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
  OPENAI_MODELS=llama-3.1-8b-instruct,qwen2.5-coder-7b
  # OPENAI_API_KEY=optional_for_local_servers   # required for hosted ones like OpenRouter
  ```
- Models listed in `OPENAI_MODELS` appear in the model dropdown alongside the built-in OpenAI models.

All providers can be configured simultaneously — choose the model per generation in the UI.

> **Want to run 100% free?** Install Ollama, pull a model, set `OLLAMA_MODELS` in `.env`, and you're done. No API keys needed. Concept art generation requires Gemini, but you can skip it and paint directly.

## Autotile Export

After generating a block sprite, click "Generate Tileset" to create all 16 autotile variants:
- Edge darkening on exposed sides
- Outline on exposed edges
- Rounded corners where two exposed edges meet

Output: `BlockName_00.png` through `BlockName_15.png`

## Scaling (Optional)

For concurrent generation support, add Redis and run workers:

```bash
# Set in .env — must be Redis Stack (RediSearch module enabled),
# not vanilla Redis. The LangGraph checkpointer needs FT.* commands.
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Local dev: run Redis Stack via Docker
docker run -d --name texel-redis -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest

# Run the API server + worker(s)
python server.py &
python worker.py &
python worker.py &  # add more workers for more parallelism
```

Workers pull jobs from a Redis queue, publish progress via pub/sub, and persist LangGraph thread state via `RedisSaver`. Any worker can resume any chat — no per-worker affinity. Vanilla Redis won't work because the checkpointer requires the search module; use Redis Stack, Redis Cloud, or a self-hosted Redis with `redisearch` enabled.

Without `REDIS_URL`, the engine runs single-process with an in-memory `MemorySaver` checkpointer — fine for personal use.

## Storage (Optional)

By default, generated images and references are saved to the local filesystem. For multi-worker deployments where workers run on separate machines, configure S3-compatible object storage:

```bash
# Set in .env — works with AWS S3, Railway Object Store, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, etc.
ENDPOINT=https://your-s3-endpoint
ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
BUCKET=your_bucket
```

Without these, everything uses the local filesystem.

## Extending — adding a new job kind

The engine has a generic `Job` abstraction. Every operation the agent does
(generate, chat, reference, tileset, photo→pixel) is registered against a
`kind` string. Adding a new kind is one file:

```python
# jobs/my_thing.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from . import JobHandler, JobContext, register_job, log, result

class MyParams(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    size: int = 16

@register_job("my.thing")
class MyHandler(JobHandler):
    Params = MyParams

    def run(self, params: MyParams, ctx: JobContext):
        yield log("Doing the thing...")
        # ... do work, optionally yield progress(...) events ...
        yield result(status="completed", payload={"hello": "world"})
```

Then import it once at startup (e.g. add `from . import my_thing` to
`jobs/__init__.py:_load_builtins`). The dispatcher picks it up automatically.

Drive it from anywhere:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8500/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"kind":"my.thing","params":{"prompt":"hi","size":32}}'
```

The same endpoint works in self-hosted (in-process) and queued (Redis) modes.
Built-in kinds:

| Kind | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sprite.generate` | AI-paints a sprite from a prompt |
| `sprite.chat` | Continues editing an existing sprite via chat |
| `sprite.reference` | Generates concept art (Gemini image gen) |
| `sprite.tileset` | Builds the 16-variant autotile from a base sprite |
| `sprite.from_photo` | Quantizes a photo to the chosen palette |

`GET /api/jobs/kinds` returns the list at runtime.

## Observability (Optional)

**LangSmith** — LangChain's tracing platform:
```bash
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_key
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=texel-studio
```

**PostHog LLM Analytics** — traces, token counts, latency, costs:
```bash
POSTHOG_API_KEY=phc_your_key
POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

Both can run in parallel. Neither is required.

## Cloud Version — [texel.studio](https://texel.studio)

Don't want to self-host? The cloud version is ready to use:

- **Sign up and start creating** — no API keys, no setup, no Python
- **5 free credits daily** — no credit card required
- **Pro plan** — $9/month for 200 credits with rollover
- **Credit packs** — buy 100, 250, or 700 credits anytime
- **Per-user palettes** — create, edit, share to a public gallery
